## What is an Orthogroup?

An **orthogroup** is a set of genes from different species that **originated from a single gene in their last common ancestor (LCA)**. These genes may have evolved through speciation and duplication events but are still considered related based on their evolutionary history.

Key Concepts:

* **Orthologs**: Genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene through speciation.

* **Paralogs**: Genes within the same species that originated from a gene duplication event. 
    
* **Orthogroups**: A group of genes (both orthologs and paralogs) that descend from a single gene in the last common ancestor.

Why Are Orthogroups Important?

* They help understand **gene evolution** across species.

* They are useful for **functional annotation** (genes in the same orthogroup often have **similar functions**).

* They are used to analyze **genetic novelty** when comparing multiple genomes: 

### What is Genetic Novelty?

Genetic novelty refers to the emergence of new genes or gene functions that were not present in an organism's ancestors. In the context of Orthofinder and orthogroups, genetic novelty is often analyzed by identifying genes that:

* Do not belong to any orthogroup (species-specific genes).

* Appear in only one or a few species (potentially recent evolutionary innovations).

* Are in an orthogroup with no known homologs in distant species (suggesting recent gene acquisition or divergence).
